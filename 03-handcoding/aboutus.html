    <h2> Who are we?</h2>
    <p>In college, we found a mutual passion for bugs, and came together learn to collect and safely keep them. We are a group of beetle enthusiasts who want to share our knowledge with the world. </p>
    <h2>What do we do?</h2>
    <p>We all share a passion for collecting beetles and practicing taxidermy. At BTL we spend our time creating educational content, and when we are not doing that we are out in the field collecting specimens. We are here to help you learn how to do the same. </p>
