<h1>How to Catch Bugs</h1>

<p>First, you figure out what it is you are trying to catch. This will let you know where to look. Beetles live in a huge variety of places, the forest, out in the bush, in fields or pastures, out in meadowsâ€¦ you get the idea.  Check near tree trunks, under rocks,  and keep an eye out for anything running across the ground. Once you have found the bugs you want to catch, use one of the following techniques to collect them:</p>
<h3>Sweeping Net</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Hold the net  with the hoop close the ground in front of you</li>
    <li> Swing the net in a 180 degree arc in front of you as you walk</li>
    <li>Make sure to keep the net moving, this is what keeps the captured bugs containted</li>
    <li>In short vegetation sweep the net as deeply as possible</li>
    <li>In tall vegetation sweep enough to keep the top of the net opening even with the height of the vegetation</li>
    </ol>
<h3>Entomological Umbrella</h3>
<p>An Entomological umbrella is an over turned umbrella that you place strategically when beating specimens from shrubs.
The umbrella is held underneath the plant that is being beat to collect the bugs as they fall. The bugs can now be collected off the umbrella. You can gather bugs from the umbrella using several different tools:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forceps</strong>: Also known as tweezers</li>
<li><strong>Pooter</strong>:A long tube that goes into the mouth, and the other over the desired bug. The collector 
inhales and the bug is sucked into the tube, and caught on a mesh inside the tube
</li>
    <li><strong>Ziploc</strong>&#8482;<strong> Bag </strong>: The bag is placed over the collector's hand as they pick up the specimen</li>
    
</ul>
